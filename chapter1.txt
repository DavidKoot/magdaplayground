Chapter 1

For the second week in a row, our country selector app sends us to a country that I have been to before. I am excited as this is one of my more favorite (and more recent) travel destinations. David is sceptical as he pictures a war torn country, with the conflict between Israeli’s and Palestinians known by most around the world. But I explain to him, that it is not like that, at least not everywhere. Israel surprised me, pleasantly. I enjoyed visiting the historical/biblical sites like Masada, Jerusalem, the Sea of Galilea, as well hanging out in the more modern Tel Aviv. I like this country and can’t wait to share my photos and adventures with David.

Israel is a Middle Eastern country that is bordered by Lebanon to the north, Syria to the northeast, Jordan and the West Bank to the east, the Red Sea to the south, Egypt to the southwest, and the Gaza strip and Mediterranean Sea to the west. It has a population of about 9 million and its proclaimed capital and seat of government is Jerusalem. The country’s official language is Hebrew. Israel is also the birthplace of Judaism and Christianity and holds significant importance to all Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Druze and Baháʼí Faith).
