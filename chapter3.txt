Chapter three

The Isle of Man is a self-governing British Crown dependency that is located in the Irish sea. It lies off the northwest coast of England, roughly equidistant between England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales. The island is about 48 km long and 16 km wide, and has an area of 572 km2. It has a population of about 85,000 and has Douglas as its capital city. Its official languages are English and Manx, and its motto, ‘Whichever way you throw it, it will stand’, demonstrates the resilience of the Manx people.
